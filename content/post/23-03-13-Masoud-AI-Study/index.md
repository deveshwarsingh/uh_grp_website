Masoud Ghahremanloo’s Work Published in Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres

A University of Houston doctoral student has developed a more accurate artificial intelligence (AI) method for reading amounts of ground-level nitrogen dioxide (NO2) with the help of satellite technology.

Masoud Ghahremanloo worked with associate professor Yunsoo Choi of the UH Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences to create a model designed to give more accurate estimates of NO2 concentrations on the Earth’s surface. Additional UH College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics doctoral students, Yannic Lops, Seyedali Mousavinezhad, and Jia Jung, also collaborated in the study.
 

Ghahremanloo’s work was published in the national scientific journal, [Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres.](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022JD037010)
