Ali holds a background in both science and engineering, specializing in numerical, machine learning, and statistical modeling for environmental pollution assessment, meteorological/climate analysis, and human health impacts. Proficient in emission and advanced atmospheric modeling, Ali integrates various data sources, including remotely sensed data, to advance research, knowledge integration, and innovative solutions. Ali's education began with a B.Sc. in Civil Engineering from Shiraz University, Iran (2008-2013). This was followed by an M.Sc. in Geotechnical Engineering from the same university (2013-2016). During this period, Ali's thesis focused on evaluating shear strength parameters of MSW in different water content conditions to examine landfill slope stability. Pursuing a deeper understanding, Ali obtained a PhD in Atmospheric Science and Meteorology from the University of Houston, Texas, USA (2019-2023). The dissertation revolved around the application of numerical modeling to assess the impacts of emissions and atmospheric physics on concentrations of criteria air pollutants and human health. Beyond research, Ali effectively communicates complex scientific and engineering findings.
