Nima's research is primarily focused on a project using WRF-Chem to model interactions between aerosols and clouds, with an emphasis on spectral bin microphysics. To enhance model accuracy, Nima employs data assimilation techniques, integrating observational data directly into the model. A key objective of this endeavor is to determine the role aerosol particles play in forming Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN), fundamental elements in cloud formation. These interactions can significantly alter atmospheric conditions, particularly affecting the size and number of cloud droplets, as well as precipitation patterns. Furthermore, he seeks to understand the processes by which aerosols serve as CCN and how clouds might subsequently impact these aerosol particles. Such dynamics might lead to the emergence of secondary aerosols, which can influence the distribution and presence of CCN. Another noteworthy aspect of Nima's research explores how aerosol particles may impact the radiative forcing of clouds, a facet with substantial implications for global climate patterns. By combining empirical data with advanced modeling techniques, Nima's work strives to elucidate the relationship between aerosols and clouds, deepening our comprehension of this essential atmospheric dynamic.
