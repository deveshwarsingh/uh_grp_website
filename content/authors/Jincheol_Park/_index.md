Jincheol (Jin) Park, born and raised in Korea, earned his Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science from the University of Texas at San Antonio in May 2013. Subsequently, he served as an aviation weather officer in the Republic of Korea Air Force from September 2013 to December 2016, holding positions including Weather Forecaster, Forecast Team Chief, and Weather Unit Commander. During this period, he provided crucial weather forecasts for numerous airborne and ground military operations, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and civilians residing nearby the aerodrome.
After completing his military service, Jincheol pursued a Master of Science in Environmental Science at the University of Texas at San Antonio, successfully graduating in 2019. His master's thesis focused on studying the migratory patterns of monarch butterflies and their interactions with prevailing winds.
Following this, Jincheol worked as a researcher at Hanyang University in Seoul, South Korea, from July 2019 to June 2020. He contributed to projects funded by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) and the Korea Forestry Promotion Institute (KOFPI), focusing on the impact of urban forests on air quality in Seoul.
In 2020, Jincheol commenced his Ph.D. studies in Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Houston, under the supervision of Dr. Yunsoo Choi. Jincheolâ€™s doctoral research encompasses areas such as numerical weather modeling and air quality modeling (i.e., WRF and CMAQ), satellite-based remote sensing, emissions inventory, and inverse problems.
