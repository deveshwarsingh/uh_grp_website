I am currently a Ph.D. candidate with a multifaceted academic journey. My foundational understanding of engineering began with a Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from Isfahan University of Technology. Building upon that, I delved deeper into environmental studies with a Master's in Civil-Environmental Engineering from the University of Tehran. My passion for the field took me further to Washington State University, where I obtained a second Master's, this time in Environmental Engineering. Before joining this Ph.D. program, I honed my research skills at Drexel University.

My research areas are diverse yet interconnected, spanning Advanced Sensitivity Analysis techniques such as DDM and Adjoint, Data Assimilation methods including 3D-Var and 4D-Var, Inverse Modeling, Climate Change, and Data Science applications. A significant portion of my work is dedicated to understanding Ammonia, Methane, and the interaction between the biosphere and the atmosphere, seeking to uncover nuances that can contribute to our environmental goals. As part of this esteemed group, I am eager to collaborate, innovate, and contribute to the broader scientific community.
