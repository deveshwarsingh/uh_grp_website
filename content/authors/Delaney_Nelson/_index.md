Delaney Nelson is a third-year PhD candidate under Dr. Yunsoo Choi. Her research has focused on using a combination of statistical and artificial intelligence models in order to complete a source apportionment study for Houston, Texas, and subsequently determine the importance/impact of different identified emissions sources and meteorological variables on predicted ozone concentrations. She is currently working on a separate case study of Houston utilizing similar methodologies to evaluate potential impacts of urbanization on air quality. For more information on her work, please find her Scholar profile [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mQrQNWAAAAAJ&hl=en), or contact her directly at dlnelson3@uh.edu.
